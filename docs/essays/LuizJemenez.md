# Fiesa

Here's a dummy essay that will gradually turn into a real model.

In the meantime, here's a **test image**, hopefully off to the right and taking up 1/3 of the page width.

{% include figure.html
  class="img-right"
  width="33%"
  caption="Mesa Vista Hall"
  src="misc_for_libguide_076.jpg"
%}
