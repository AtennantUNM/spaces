# hello dr. gibbs

I hope your week is going well

Here are a few things I did this week: 

- saw my cat 
- experienced despair that school ends in 5 weeks 
- stayed up way to late because I watched a horror film
> the horror film was called US, recently released, and directed/created by Jordan Peele. More creepy than horror, and not a ton of jump scares, but it still leaves you feeling like someone is out there watching you. 

## anyways, have a good week
