# Jessica Bowen's Dummy Text
Here is some _very nice_ text showing off **all** of the cool things I can do for Fred Gibbs' [Digital History course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-history/schedule.html) using Markdown. 
* _Italicized text_  
  * very good for emphasis
* **bold** text
  * for strong feelings
* even image links ![a very nice honeybee](https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/3179218B-6138-442F-AA4D3E3EF7E98924_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&99504431-06EB-4FF1-A29FDD6444A58577) 

> Very important ideas belong in block quotes.


#### Conclusion  
Markdown is a fun puzzle.
